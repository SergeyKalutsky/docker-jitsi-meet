# Jitsi Meet on Docker

![](resources/jitsi-docker.png)

[Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) is a set of Open Source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions.

[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) is a fully encrypted, 100% Open Source video conferencing solution that you can use all day, every day, for free — with no account needed.

This repository contains the necessary tools to run a Jitsi Meet stack on [Docker](https://www.docker.com) using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

All our images are published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/jitsi/).

## Manual Certbot renewal

For deployments where Jitsi's built-in ACME client is disabled and Certbot
uses standalone HTTP validation, set `DOMAIN` and `ENABLE_LETSENCRYPT=0` in
`.env`, start the stack, and install the renewal hooks:

```bash
sudo bash ./install-certbot-renewal-hooks.sh --dry-run
```

The installer discovers the host directory mounted at `/config`, immediately
copies the current certificate and reloads Nginx, then installs renewal hooks.
For future validation it stops only the web container, copies renewed
certificates into the Jitsi volume, and starts the web container again. The
system `certbot.timer` is enabled automatically, so a separate cron entry is
not required.

## Supported architectures

Starting with `stable-7439` the published images are available for `amd64` and `arm64`.

## Tags

These are the currently published tags for all our images:

Tag | Description
-- | --
`stable` | Points to the latest stable release

## Installation

The installation manual is available [here](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-docker).

### Kubernetes

If you plan to install the jitsi-meet stack on a Kubernetes cluster you can find tools and tutorials in the project [Jitsi on Kubernetes](https://github.com/jitsi-contrib/jitsi-kubernetes).
